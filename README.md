# Report on Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS): Reusability and Security

### Course 2024- 2DV505

## Summary of the Report

This report focuses on making self-adaptive systems (SAS) both reusable and secure by leveraging existing methodologies and addressing their limitations. Key frameworks like **ASPLe (Autonomic Software Product Line Engineering)** and **eARF (Extended Architectural Reasoning Framework)** are utilized to establish a robust foundation for systematic reuse and security evaluation in SAS. These methodologies aim to solve critical challenges such as dependency conflicts, safety certification issues, and security vulnerabilities in dynamic environments.

However, the report extends beyond the capabilities of these frameworks, addressing gaps and proposing new solutions. It incorporates techniques like **dynamic validation**, which tests components at runtime for safety and adaptability, and integrates **adaptable safety certifications**, ensuring reused components meet evolving safety standards. These contributions create a comprehensive framework for **SAS** that is practical and applicable to industries like healthcare, smart cities, and autonomous systems.

## Key Topics in the Report

### 1. Introduction to Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS)

- **SAS** are systems capable of **monitoring, analyzing, and adjusting** their behavior automatically to adapt to environmental changes with minimal human intervention.
- **Applications**:
  - **Healthcare**: Real-time patient monitoring systems that adapt to changing health conditions.
  - **Smart Cities**: Dynamic traffic and energy management systems.
  - **Autonomous Vehicles**: Systems adapting to obstacles or weather changes.

### 2. Systematic Reuse in SAS

- Reusing components across different systems saves time and cost but introduces challenges such as:
  - **Dependency conflicts** between reused components.
  - **Loss of safety certifications** in new environments.
  - **Security risks** from pre-existing vulnerabilities in reused architectures.

### 3. ASPLe: Methodology for Reuse

- **Process**:
  - **Domain Engineering**: Build general, reusable components.
  - **Specialization**: Customize components for specific requirements.
  - **Integration**: Combine components into a full system.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces development complexity by modularizing managed and managing system concerns.
  - Promotes flexibility and scalability.

### 4. eARF: Decision-Making for Reuse

- **Purpose**:
  - Evaluate the reuse potential of components in new systems.
  - Identify necessary modifications for safety and compatibility.
- **Example**:
  - Reusing a traffic control system in a new smart city project with modifications for local regulations.

### 5. Challenges of Reuse in SAS

- **Safety Issues**:
  - Safety certifications lose validity after adaptation.
  - Lack of standardized methods for modeling adaptation processes.
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Reused components may carry vulnerabilities exploitable in new environments.
- **Increased Complexity**:
  - Reuse requires rigorous validation to ensure components function effectively in diverse contexts.

## Proposed Solutions

To address the challenges of reusability and security in SAS, the report introduces several solutions:

1. **Dynamic Validation**:
   - Validates reused components during runtime to ensure safety and functionality.
   - Example: A reused navigation module dynamically tested to avoid obstacles in a warehouse.
2. **Adaptable Safety Certifications**:
   - Certifies components post-adaptation to ensure they meet new safety standards.
3. **Standardized Modeling Frameworks**:
   - Creates consistent methodologies for seamless component integration.
4. **Security Hardening**:
   - Incorporates rigorous updates and testing to address emerging threats.
5. **Integrated Safety and Security Design**:
   - Treats safety and security as interconnected elements during the reuse process.

## Contributions and Practical Implications

- **Enhanced ASPLe and eARF**:
  - ASPLe is extended with dynamic validation techniques, improving safety during runtime.
  - eARF integrates adaptable safety certifications, enabling components to evolve with system requirements.
- **Link Between Safety and Security**:
  - The report emphasizes the interdependence of safety and security, proposing integrated solutions to address both simultaneously.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - The proposed framework is applicable to critical industries, including:
    - **Healthcare**: Ensuring patient monitoring systems remain secure and reliable.
    - **Smart Cities**: Building resilient energy and traffic management systems.
    - **Autonomous Systems**: Adapting vehicles to unpredicted changes safely.
